      <t>This document specifies mechanisms to configure Distributed Denial of
      Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) clients with their DOTS servers.
      The discovery procedure also covers the DOTS Signal Channel Call Home.
      Knowing the appropriate DOTS server for a given location can be useful
      to engage mitigation actions even in cases where the DOTS client cannot
      localize the attack, but only knows that some resources are under attack
      and that help is needed.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) <xref target="RFC8811"></xref>
      specifies an architecture, in which a DOTS client can inform a DOTS
      server that the network is under a potential attack and that appropriate
      mitigation actions are required. Indeed, because the lack of a common
      method to coordinate a real-time response among involved actors and
      network domains inhibits the effectiveness of DDoS attack mitigation,
      the DOTS signal channel protocol <xref target="RFC8782"></xref> is meant
      to carry requests for DDoS attack mitigation. With this approach, DOTS
      can reduce the impact of an attack and lead to more efficient defensive
      actions in various deployment scenarios such as those discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref>. Moreover, DOTS clients can
      instruct a DOTS server to install named filtering rules by means of the
      DOTS data channel protocol <xref target="RFC8782"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The basic high-level DOTS architecture is illustrated in <xref
      target="arch"></xref>.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8811"></xref> specifies that the DOTS client may be
      provided with a list of DOTS servers, each associated with one or more
      IP addresses. These addresses may or may not be of the same address
      family. The DOTS client establishes one or more DOTS sessions by
      connecting to the provided DOTS server addresses.</t>

      <t>This document specifies methods for DOTS clients to discover their
      DOTS server(s). The rationale for specifying multiple discovery
      mechanisms is discussed in <xref target="rationale"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The discovery methods can also be used by a DOTS server to locate a
      DOTS client in the context of DOTS Signal Channel Call Home <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-call-home"></xref>. The basic high-level
      DOTS Call Home architecture is illustrated in <xref
      target="fa"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A DOTS agent may be used to establish base DOTS channels, DOTS Call
      Home, or both. This specification accommodates all these deployment
      cases.</t>

      <t>Considerations for the selection of DOTS server(s) by multi-homed
      DOTS clients are out of scope; readers should refer to <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-multihoming"></xref> for more details.</t>

      <t>This document assumes that security credentials to authenticate DOTS
      server(s) are pre-provisioned to a DOTS client using a mechanism such as
      (but not limited to) those discussed in <xref target="RFC8572"></xref>
      or <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref>. DOTS
      clients use those credentials for authentication purposes following the
      rules documented in <xref target="RFC8782"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC3958"></xref>.</t>

      <t>DHCP refers to both DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and DHCPv6
      <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>.</t>

      <t>"DOTS client" refers to a DOTS-aware software module responsible for
      requesting attack response coordination with other DOTS-aware
      elements.</t>

      <t>"DOTS server" is a DOTS-aware software module handling and responding
      to messages from DOTS clients. The DOTS server enables mitigation on
      behalf of the DOTS client, if requested, by communicating the DOTS
      client's request to the mitigator and returning selected mitigator
      feedback to the requesting DOTS client.</t>

      <t>"Call Home DOTS client" (or "Call Home DOTS server") refers to a DOTS
      client (or DOTS server) deployed in a Call Home scenario (<xref

      <t>"DOTS agent" is any DOTS-aware software module capable of
      participating in a DOTS channel.</t>

      <t>"Peer DOTS agent" refers to the peer DOTS server (base DOTS
      operation) or to a peer Call Home DOTS client (for DOTS Signal Channel
      Call Home).</t>

    <section anchor="rationale" title="Why Multiple Discovery Mechanisms?">
      <t>Analysis of the various use cases sketched in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref> reveals that it is unlikely
      that one single discovery method can be suitable for all the sample
      deployments. Concretely:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Many of the use cases discussed in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref> do involve a Customer
          Premises Equipment (CPE) device. Multiple CPEs, connected to
          distinct network providers, may even be considered. It is intuitive
          to leverage existing mechanisms such as discovery using service
          resolution or DHCP to provision the CPE acting as a DOTS client with
          the DOTS server(s).</t>

          <t>Resolving a DOTS server domain name offered by an upstream
          transit provider provisioned to a DOTS client into IP address(es)
          requires the use of the appropriate DNS resolvers; otherwise,
          resolving those names will fail. The use of protocols such as DHCP
          does allow associating provisioned DOTS server domain names with a
          list of DNS servers to be used for name resolution. Furthermore,
          DHCP allows directly providing IP addresses therefore avoiding the
          need for extra lookup delays.</t>

          <t>Some of the use cases may allow DOTS clients to have direct
          communications with upstream DOTS servers, that is, no DOTS gateway
          is involved. Leveraging existing protocol behaviors that do not
          require specific features on the node embedding the DOTS client may
          ease DOTS deployment. Typically, the use of Straightforward-Naming
          Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR) lookups <xref target="RFC3958"></xref>
          allows the DOTS server administrators to provision the preferred
          DOTS transport protocol between the DOTS client and the DOTS server
          and allows the DOTS client to discover this preference.</t>

          <t>The upstream network provider is not the DDoS mitigation provider
          for some of these use cases. It is safe to assume that for such
          deployments, the DOTS server(s) domain name is provided during the
          service subscription (i.e., manual/local configuration).</t>

          <t>Multiple DOTS clients may be enabled within a network (e.g.,
          enterprise network). Dynamic means to discover DOTS servers in a
          deterministic manner are interesting from an operational
          standpoint.</t>

          <t>Some of the use cases may involve a DOTS gateway that is
          responsible for selecting the appropriate DOTS server(s) to relay
          requests received from DOTS clients.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Consequently, this document describes a unified discovery logic
      (<xref target="logic"></xref>) which involves the following
      mechanisms:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Dynamic discovery using DHCP (<xref target="dhcp"></xref>).</t>

          <t>A resolution mechanism based on Straightforward Naming Authority
          Pointer (S-NAPTR) resource records in the Domain Name System (DNS)
          (<xref target="srvr"></xref>).</t>

          <t>DNS Service Discovery (<xref target="DNSSD"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="logic" title="Unified DOTS Discovery Procedure">
      <t>Operators will need a consistent set of ways in which DOTS clients
      can discover this information and a consistent priority among these
      options. If some devices prefer manual configuration over dynamic
      discovery, while others prefer dynamic discovery over manual
      configuration, the result will be a process of "whack-a-mole", where the
      operator must find devices that are using the wrong DOTS server(s),
      determine how to ensure the devices are configured properly, and then
      reconfigure the device through the preferred method.</t>

      <t>All DOTS clients MUST support at least one of the three mechanisms
      below to determine a DOTS server list. All DOTS clients SHOULD implement
      all three, or as many as are practical for any specific device, of the
      following ways to discover DOTS servers in order to facilitate the
      deployment of DOTS in large scale environments. For example, a CPE will
      support the first two mechanisms, a host within a LAN will support the
      last two mechanisms, or an application server will support a local
      configuration. More examples are discussed in <xref
      target="rationale"></xref>.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Explicit configuration:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Local/Manual configuration: A DOTS client will learn the DOTS
              server(s) by means of local or manual DOTS configuration (i.e.,
              DOTS servers configured at the system level). Configuration
              discovered from a DOTS client application is considered as local
              configuration.<vspace blankLines="1" />An implementation may
              give the user an opportunity (e.g., by means of configuration
              file options or menu items) to specify DOTS server(s) for each
              address family. These may be specified either as a list of IP
              addresses or the DNS name of a DOTS server. When only DOTS
              server IP addresses are configured, a reference identifier must
              also be configured for authentication purposes.</t>

              <t>Automatic configuration (e.g., DHCP): The DOTS client
              attempts to discover DOTS server(s) names and/or addresses from
              DHCP, as described in <xref target="dhcp"></xref>.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Service Resolution : The DOTS client attempts to discover DOTS
          server name(s) using service resolution, as specified in <xref
          target="srvr"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DNS SD: DNS Service Discovery. The DOTS client attempts to
          discover DOTS server name(s) using DNS service discovery, as
          specified in <xref target="DNSSD"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some of these mechanisms imply the use of DNS to resolve the IP
      address(es) of the DOTS server, while others imply an IP address of the
      relevant DOTS server is obtained directly. Implementation options may
      vary on a per device basis, as some devices may not have DNS
      capabilities and/or suitable DNS configuration.</t>

      <t>DOTS clients will prefer information received from the discovery
      methods in the order listed.</t>

      <t>On hosts with more than one interface or address family (IPv4/IPv6),
      the DOTS server discovery procedure has to be performed for each
      interface/address-family combination. A DOTS client may choose to
      perform the discovery procedure only for a desired interface/address
      combination if the client does not wish to discover a DOTS server for
      all interface/address-family combinations.</t>

      <t>This procedure is also followed by a Call Home DOTS server to
      discover its Call Home DOTS client in the context of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-call-home"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The discovery method is performed upon bootstrapping of a DOTS agent,
      and is reiterated by the DOTS agent upon the following events:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Expiry of a validity timer (e.g., DHCP lease, DNS TTL) associated
          with a discovered DOTS agent.</t>

          <t>Expiry of a peer DOTS agent's certificate currently in use.</t>

          <t>Attachment to a new network.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="dhcp" title="DHCP Options for DOTS Agent Discovery">
      <t>As reported in Section 1.7.2 of <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>:<list
          style="empty">
          <t>"Some certification authorities issue server certificates based
          on IP addresses, but preliminary evidence indicates that such
          certificates are a very small percentage (less than 1%) of issued
          certificates".</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In order to allow for PKIX-based authentication between a DOTS client
      and server while accommodating the current best practices for issuing
      certificates, this document allows DOTS agents to retrieve the names of
      their peer DOTS agents. These names can be used for two purposes: to
      retrieve the list of IP addresses of a peer DOTS agent or to be
      presented as a reference identifier for authentication purposes.</t>

      <t>Defining the option to include a list of IP addresses would avoid a
      dependency on an underlying name resolution, but that design requires
      also supplying a name for PKIX-based authentication purposes.</t>

      <t>Given that DOTS gateways can be involved in a DOTS session, a peer
      DOTS agent can be reachable using a link-local address. Such addresses
      can also be discovered using the options defined in <xref
      target="opt"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The list of the IP addresses returned by DHCP servers is typically
      used to feed the DOTS server selection procedure including when DOTS
      agents are provided with primary and backup IP addresses of their peer
      DOTS agents. An example of DOTS server selection procedure is specified
      in Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC8782"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The design assumes that the same peer DOTS agent is used for
      establishing both signal and data channels. For more customized
      configurations (e.g., transport-specific configuration, distinct DOTS
      servers for the signal and the data channels), an operator can supply
      only a DOTS reference identifier that will be then passed to the
      procedure described in <xref target="srvr"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The design allows terminating the base DOTS channels and DOTS Call
      Home on the same or distinct peer DOTS agents. If distinct peer DOTS
      agents are deployed, the DHCP option can return, for example, a list of
      IP addresses to a requesting DOTS agent. This list includes the IP
      address to be used for the base DOTS channels and the IP address for the
      DOTS Call Home. The DOTS client (or Call Home DOTS server) will then use
      the address selection procedure specified in Section 4.3 of <xref
      target="RFC8782"></xref> to identify the IP address of the peer DOTS
      server (or Call Home DOTS client). For example: <list style="empty">
          <t>Let's consider that the DOTS server is reachable at
          2001:db8:122:300::1 while the Call Home DOTS client is reachable at
          2001:db8:122:300::2. The DHCP server will then return one DOTS
          reference identifier and a list that includes both
          2001:db8:122:300::1 and 2001:db8:122:300::2 to a requesting DHCP
          client. That list is passed to the DOTS client (or Call Home DOTS
          server) which will try to establish connections to the addresses of
          that list and destination port number 4646 (or the Call Home port
          number). As a result, the DOTS client (or Call Home DOTS server)
          will select 2001:db8:122:300::1 (or 2001:db8:122:300::2) as a DOTS
          server (or Call Home DOTS client).</t>

      <t>This mechanism is performed in two steps:<list style="numbers">
          <t>A DNS domain name is retrieved for each combination of interface
          and address family. A DOTS agent has to determine the domain in
          which it is located relying on dynamic means such as DHCP (<xref
          target="dhcp"></xref>). Implementations may allow the user to
          specify a default name that is used, if no specific name has been
          configured.</t>

          <t>Retrieved DNS domain names are then used for S-NAPTR lookups
          <xref target="RFC3958"></xref>. Further DNS lookups may be necessary
          to determine the peer DOTS agent IP address(es).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Once the DOTS agent has retrieved its DNS domain or discovered the
      peer DOTS agent name that needs to be resolved, an S-NAPTR lookup with
      the appropriate application service and the desired protocol tag is made
      to obtain information necessary to connect to the authoritative peer
      DOTS agent within the given domain.</t>

      <t>This specification defines 'DOTS' and 'DOTS-CALL-HOME' as application
      service tags (Sections <xref format="counter" target="serviceT"></xref>
      and <xref format="counter" target="serviceT2"></xref>). It also defines
      "signal.udp" (<xref target="suappt"></xref>), "signal.tcp" (<xref
      target="stappt"></xref>), and "data.tcp" (<xref target="dappt"></xref>)
      as application protocol tags. An example is provided in <xref
      target="ssrv"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In the example below, for domain 'example.net', the resolution

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>DOTS-related security considerations are discussed in Section 4 of
      <xref target="RFC8811"></xref>. As a reminder, DOTS agents must
      authenticate each other using (D)TLS before a DOTS session is considered
      valid according to the <xref target="RFC8782"></xref>.</t>

      <t>An attacker may block some protocol messages (e.g., DHCP) to force
      the client to use a discovery mechanism with a lower priority. The
      security implications of such attack are those inherent to the fallback
      discovery mechanism discussed in the following subsections.</t>

      <t>The results of the discovery procedure are a function of the
      interface/address family. Contacting a discovered DOTS server via an
      interface to which it is not bound may exacerbate the delay required to
      establish a DOTS channel. Moreover, such behavior may reveal that a DOTS
      service is enabled by a DOTS client domain and exposes the identity of
      the DOTS service provider (that can be inferred from the name and the
      destination IP address) to external networks.</t>

      <t>Security considerations related to how security credentials to
      authenticate DOTS server(s) are provisioned to a DOTS client are those
      inherent to the mechanism used for that purpose (see for example, <xref
      target="RFC8572"></xref>).</t>

      <section title="DHCP">
        <t>The security considerations in <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and
        <xref target="RFC8415"></xref> are to be considered. In particular,
        issues related to rogue DHCP servers and means to mitigate many of
        these attacks are discussed in Section 22 of <xref
        target="RFC8415"></xref>.</t>

        <t>An attacker can get a domain name, domain-validated public
        certificate from a CA, and host a DOTS agent. An active attacker can
        then spoof DHCP responses to include the attacker's DOTS agent. Such
        an attacker can also launch other attacks as discussed in Section 22
        of <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>. In addition to the mitigations
        listed in Section 22 of <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>, a DOTS agent
        may be pre-configured with a list of trusted DOTS domain names. If
        such a list is pre-configured, a DOTS agent will accept a
        DHCP-discovered name if it matches a name in that list. Also, the DOTS
        agent has to check that the 'DNS-ID' identifier type within
        subjectAltName in the server certificate matches a pre-configured
        name. If the DOTS agent is instructed to trust subdomains of the names
        in that list as well (e.g., "*.example.com"), a DOTS agent will accept
        a DHCP-discovered name that matches a name in the pre-configured list
        (e.g., "dots-1.example.com" or "dots-2.example.com").</t>

        <t>Relying on an underlying resolution library to resolve a supplied
        reference identifier has similar security issues as those discussed in
        <xref target="res"></xref> (e.g., an active attacker may modify DNS
        messages used to resolve the supplied reference identifier and point
        the client to an attacker server).</t>

        <t>Supplying both an IP address and the reference identifier makes it
        easier to use a mis-issued certificate.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="res" title="Service Resolution">
        <t>The primary attack against the methods described in <xref
        target="srvr"></xref> is one that would lead to impersonation of a
        peer DOTS agent. An attacker could attempt to compromise the S-NAPTR
        resolution.</t>

        <t>The DOTS client (or a Call Home DOTS server) constructs one
        reference identifier for the DOTS server (or a Call Home DOTS client)
        based on the domain name which is used for S-NAPTR lookup: DNS-ID. If
        the reference identifier is found (as described in Section 6 of <xref
        target="RFC6125"></xref>) in the PKIX certificate's subjectAltName
        extension, the DOTS client should accept the certificate for the
        server.</t>

        <t>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033"></xref>
        uses cryptographic keys and digital signatures to provide
        authentication of DNS data. The information that is retrieved from the
        S-NAPTR lookup and that is validated using DNSSEC is thereby proved to
        be the authoritative data.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DNS Service Discovery">
        <t>Since DNS-SD is a specification for how to name and use records in
        the existing DNS system, it has no specific additional security
        requirements over and above those that already apply to DNS queries
        and DNS updates. For DNS queries, DNSSEC SHOULD be used where the
        authenticity of information is important. For DNS updates, secure
        updates <xref target="RFC2136"></xref><xref target="RFC3007"></xref>
        SHOULD generally be used to control which clients have permission to
        update DNS records.</t>
